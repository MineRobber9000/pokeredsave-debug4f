# pokeredsave-debug4f

A Pokemon Red save that uses 4F as a debug item.

Requires [my fork of RGBBIN](//github.com/MineRobber9000/rgbbin/tree/update-to-rgb-6) and [my .sav file library](//github.com/MineRobber9000/savfiles).

Based on [pokeredsave-base](//github.com/MineRobber9000/pokeredsave-base).
